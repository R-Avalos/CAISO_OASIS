CAISO Oasis  
  
Creating package to connect with the California Independent System Operators OASIS API.  

Currently in initial stage to: 
1. Call API in a nice manner
2. Parse received XML (some data is CSV and XML, some only XML :/ )
3. Focus Atlas data for Nodes and Load Aggregation Points
4. Historical pricing by node calls
5. Convert to Package
